yawrap - yet another wrapper
============================

Yawrap is a pseudo static html (actually a xml) builder.


yattag
------

Yawrap core is `yattag <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yattag>`_  library written by Benjamin Le Forestier.

The yattag is very well documented and I strongly recommend reading its `quick reference <http://www.yattag.org/>`_.

Unfortunately when I asked Benjamin for extending yattag functionality,
he suggested to make it a separate package, so that's how the yawrap was born.
